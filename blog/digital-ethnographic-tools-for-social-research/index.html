		<p>Ethonographic and interview methods for the social sciences have been around since the professionalization of the academic fields themselves. The idea of moving into a social field and interacting with participants can, without a doubt, yield rich data that other quantitative and survey methods leave on the table.</p>
<p>A tension exists for the researcher or being <em>in the moment</em> and storaging traces of that moment for analysis and data presentation in scholarly work. Undoubtedly, if the researcher is immersed in the environment and allowing themseves to engage with others in that environment, a retreat to either jot down field notes or to undertake a transcription is an interuption that not only takes one out of the environemnt, but extends the amount of time spent in the field &ldquo;generating&rdquo; research data. In an ideal world, research data is &ldquo;generated&rdquo; by the experience, not by the researcher's construction of a medium in which to copy that experience.</p>
<p>But what if it was possible? What if immersive research was simply a matter of entering a field and engaging? What if the experience itself generated the mechanisms for the scholarly production of research evidence. It is towards these ideals, that I believe the tools at the disposal of the researcher should aspire. The ability to join the field of the subjects and to allow onself to become a participant and less an observer. While these ideals are simply that &ndash; ideals &ndash; it should be an Asymptote, like in mathematics, approaching an endpoint that is objectively impossible, but with each step forward getting closer and closer towards that goal.</p>
<p>With that being said I think there are a number of tools that are indespensible towards that end. Your mileage may vary, but that being said, these recommendations will get your pretty far.</p>
<h1 id="smartphone">Smartphone</h1>
<p>While this may be contreversial, I would assert that unless you're engaging with a very isolated population that has never seen a smartphone, <strong>this should be the only item you bring with you</strong>. Now, before you conjure up the many things that you can't do with just a smartphone, take a moment and recognize that these limitations here are intentional. Engaging with the field is not about having all of your tools at your disposal in whichever medium you feel comfortable using them. The less mediums that you have at your disposal the better you will engage in the environment.</p>
<p>Before I talk about the <em>what</em> you can do with this single tool, I'll first go over the <em>why</em> you whould only use this single tool.</p>
<h3 id="priming">Priming</h3>
<p>Firstly, in nearly every situation, carrying a smartphone is not going to raise anyone's attention that you are a researcher. You will not be priming anyone's perspective as to how they see you. You alone control the identification of yourself as a researcher. You can direct the time and place in which you make that identification ( if at all ). By allowing yourself the freedom to control that, you place yourself on the best footing to control your standing and your subject's confort with your standing as a researcher interested in engaging with their lived environment. The more that you reflect the values and culture of the people that you engage with the easier you will find the experience of gathering answers to your questions.</p>
<h3 id="observer-effect">Observer Effect</h3>
<p>As a researcher engaging with the field &ndash; interacting with participants, subjects and resources available to you &ndash; you're bound to draw attention to yourself. While this effect is challenging to mitigate, the less objects that you bring with you to the field, the better chances you will have of subjects welcoming you to their spaces as a participant versus as an observer. The reasons for minimizing the observer effect as myriad, but the main thrust of the outcome is that you'll be able to achieve greater depth in your findings the more that you become a participant and the less that you become an observer of your subjects within the field.</p>
<h2 id="tools-of-smartphone-only-field-research">Tools of smartphone-only field-research</h2>
<p>As a researcher, your main outcome from most ethnographic and interview research is to produce traces of your engagement that can facilitate the production of a wide variety of research reports (articles, books, statistical charts, etc.). Those traces are simply a step along in the process of the final outcome. As you build up those traces over time, the researcher is able to derive meaningful content from their experiences in the field that are accurate representations of the events that unfolded while engaging with the field. Accordingly, it's important not to confuse a production of high-quality field notes with the production of high-quality research reporting. The two are distinct, and the production of classically-organized field notes may correlate with the production of high quality research reporting outcomes, but like any good social scientist knows, that does not imply causation.</p>
<h3 id="audio-records">Audio Records</h3>
<p>Undoubtedly, audio records are one of the most useful tools for ethnographers and interviewers in the field. Having an audio recording of the subjects&rsquo; interactions with the researcher and with other members of the community will provide an accorate trace of conversations and events. Both iOS and Android devices have build in audio recording apps, some of which automatically turn the audio into a transcription on the fly ( Recorder, Just Press Record ). By using an audio recorder, you'll have an accurate transcription of the event, avoiding one of the more tedious and time-consuming activities of turning events and interviews into text which can be collated and copied for report production.</p>
<p>I personally use the Just Press Record application, which operates in the background, and provides a text transcription of everything that is recorded. While the text is not going to be 100 percent at the first pass, I find it nearly completely accurate. If there's window of audio that I intend to quote for a research report, I will replay the audio for that segment and make any corrections in the report. This process has saved me weeks of transacription and wrote grunt work of collecting research notes.</p>
<p>In addition to capturing external sounds, I have found it particularly useful to use the audio transcription function to speak my personal field notes instead of writing it down. Not only is it faster than writing in script on pen and paper, but saves me from having to bring any materials that might take me out of the element. You can use my own tool <a href="/resources">Noted</a> where you can email the transcription to <a href="mailto:emails@trynoted.net">emails@trynoted.net</a> and it will store the note under your user email account and auto-classify events, places, and objects with machine learning.</p>
<h3 id="video-records">Video Records</h3>
<p>Video recordings can be especially useful for capturing details of events that are brief in nature, yet rich in their context. For instance, let's presume that you're in a community that's holding a race, for whatever reason. That race is brief in nature, has a large number of spectators and participants and is quite nosisy with conversation, cheering and other sounds. Capturing audio or photos of this event will not do it justice. Having a video recording where you can see the subjects will capture a more vivid collection of the experience.</p>
<p>Video, and photos for that matter, can be an instance of taking oneself out of the field. As you step behind the camera, your subjects step front stage and you find yourself backstage to use Goffman's analogy. There are certain context however, where this behavior is not only expected but also considered normal for the communities that you're engaging with. Events, celebrations and other limited window experiences invite subjects to utilize their own smartphones to save memories of the events.</p>
<h3 id="photo-records">Photo Records</h3>
<p>Photos have a unique quality to capture a vivid presentation of a single moment. There's a richness to the still frame, that when properly composed, cannot be replicated by either text, audio, or video. Every smartphone that you can buy has a camera that captures photos for this reason, amongst many others. I find photos useful to punctuate an audio recording of an experience. It can set the memories of the place and it's surroundings very effectively when reconvening to generate research reports. It can also capture details of people and provide details about their appearance that might otherwise go unnoticed until a close eye examines how these individuals chose to present themselves to the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="text-records">Text Records</h3>
<p>While audio certainly an efficient means of generating a textual record of events, conversations and experiences of what people say, often there's a need to operate on a seaparate channel from the lived experience. By separate channel, I mean to say that if you're talking and engaging with an individual and wish to make a note that would be inappropriate to speak outlound, a researcher has to make a record of that instance on a different medium utilizing a different channel than the participant is privy to. One of the reasons that SMS texting was and remains so popular is it's ability to provide for third-party communication on an asynchrous background channel. You can be in the room with another person and engaging with them, but during moments of non-engagement asynchrous conversations can be made with their-parties via text-chat on mobile devices.</p>
<p>This form of backchanneling can be useful for situations in which front-stage speaking of aresearch notes is not possible or would be inappropriate to either the participants or to the situation. All smartphones have access to a Notes application that can be used for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="tools-of-smartphone-only-note-analysis">Tools of smartphone-only note analysis</h2>
<p>Provided that you're spent a decent amount of time engaging with and observing upon your research subjects, you've generated a decent amount of audio, text, video and photos of your subjects. In most ethnographic and interview research, a good amount of time is spent in transcription of the audio and video to get textual content that can be synthesized for research report generation. If you've used an application that transcribes audio to text, you've saved yourself weeks of work in this process. At the same time, you've also generated a large volume of text and images that need to be organized in a manner that makes sense to you and allows you to discover themes, categories and areas of potential evidence to support your research claims.</p>
<h3 id="natual-language-processing-nlp">Natual Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
<p>There is no one size fits all approach to organizing your field notes. Some people like to use a tool like AtlasTI to store and categorize all the notes in a database-like fashion. Some like to create text files for individual themes that they might use in various chapters or sections of research reports. Whever the approach may be, I find some commonalities to the &ldquo;tagging&rdquo; of a given section of text. I've noticed that some of the important markers for myself, when building a corpus of research notes, have been &ldquo;entities&rdquo;, namely the person, place or thing that is being referenced or doing the referencing. From those entities it's much easier to extract themes, or connect two pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Having does this process manually for years with much effort, I now let cloud services perform the heavy lifting for me. Google has a great Natural Language Processing Tool, that let's you classify entities in a body of text for free ( or nearly free for a large volume of text ). It pulls out tags like organizations, people, goods, products, numbers, events and more. Generating tags like this let's me answer questions like: Where are all the the times that Person X talked about people? Or What are all the places that person X talked about?</p>
<h3 id="latex">LaTeX</h3>
<p>It may seem old-school, but generating reports in LaTeX has its advantages. The chief one, for me seems to be the ability to never worry about formatting. If I'm sending an article to a journal for publication, I can simply write the article in the generic article class and let the editors do their magic when it comes time to format it according to their styleguides. I'm not saying that every editor is going to be this lenient, but if you're looking for a universal document production system, this is the closest that you're going to get. One of my least favorite editorial tasks is to check the proper format of a bibliography and the integrity of all the references in the article. Using LaTeX, this is a moot point as the references are hyperlinked to their appropriate bibliography item.</p>
<h1 id="general-notes">General Notes</h1>
<p>A major theme of this summary post has been the impetus to allow technology to do a good deal of the manual work for you. Some readers will disagree with this approach, but that is perfectly normal. This approach is simply of of many correct ways to generate content for interview and ethnographic research. At it's core, I believe that leveraging technology to generate the traces of your experiences allows you to remain present and focus on the larger picture of your research project. Simplifying tools that you use and letting those tools operate in the background makes for a better researcher, one whos is not bogged down in doing the research, but one who is capable of engaging and presenting the finding of their expereiences.</p>
