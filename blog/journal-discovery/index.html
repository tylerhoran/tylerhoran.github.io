		<h3 id="theres-a-lot-of-information-out-there">There&rsquo;s a lot of information out there.</h3>
<p>The best place to start is to make two lists (one of which is probably already available online).</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the top journals in your field?</li>
<li>What are the top journals in your field that cater to your research interests?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have your lists. They may or may not have the same journals on them. The combination of your lists should be atleast 10 and at most 50. Realizing here that &ldquo;top&rdquo; is a relative term, one should fallback to some quantitative measures, that hopefully, many of the lists available on the web utilize. Firstly, how many citations does the average article get for each issue? Secondly, how often is that article downloaded or read?</p>
<p>Once you have this top list, you&rsquo;re bound to find other journals that citations are mentioning. Feel free to ad them to your journal list. Over time, you&rsquo;ll learn which one&rsquo;s are worth paying attention to, and which ones are worth leaving aside until one of your research literature reviews guides you back in that direction.
This, however, leads to the fundamental question of how best to read the latest and maintain a sense of sanity. Firstly, you need to develop a method of standardizing your journal articles to a single channel. If your institution has journal new issue alerts, then by all means subscribe to those new issue alerts via your email address, and read the new issues in the academic portal. On the other hand, I&rsquo;d hazard a guess that most universities have spotty journal subscription coverage when it comes to new issues. Most also, generally do not have the ability to be notified of new issues as they arise.</p>
<p>My own tool, Journaled, available in the <a href="/resources">resources</a> resction, does just this. You can create a version of the application ( a web tool ), and subscribe to as many journals as you wish. New issue and article notifications are delivered to you via email and you can download the content of the article from sources on the web.</p>
<p>Not only does using this tool save you time, but you can use it to download pdfs, which you can import into citation managers like PaperPile (Zotero) or Mendeley. Having a quick and easy way to read and be notified of the latest scientific literature is really something that every institution should have, but unfortunately the reality is far from it.</p>
